"*CDReplayToTrack*" is a utility to extract a map (.trk) from a Crashday replay file (.rpl). The program supports all current existing versions of replay (1.0, 1.1 or later, Redline Edition). The program is a WinForms application made on C Sharp language.
## Usage
**Attention!** To run the application, you need to install [.NET Desktop Runtime 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) or higher.

To extract a track, select the replay file and then click on "*Extract*". For faster extraction, you can use the "Drag-and-drop" feature and thus the track will be extracted in the folder with the replay file.
